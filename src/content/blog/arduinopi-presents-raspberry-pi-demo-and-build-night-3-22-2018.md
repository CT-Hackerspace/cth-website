<hr />

The second part of our group name goes beyond the Arduino into the Raspberry Pi. In this meeting we will give a short intro into the single board computer and learn what its capabilities are. Discussion will include setup, programming, and various projects that are popular on this board. The second half of the night will be dedicated to working on projects. If you have a Raspberry Pi that you would like to get set or work with, bring it along. This is the perfect time to get comfortable with the board or work on your own project.
