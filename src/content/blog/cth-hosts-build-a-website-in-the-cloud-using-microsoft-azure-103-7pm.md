[RSVP TODAY](https://www.meetup.com/Hackster-it-Hardware-Meetup-Watertown/events/234181842/)

Did you know you can use Microsoft Azure to build a low-or-no cost WordPress instance? Sean will go over the current steps it takes to build a Website using Microsoft's cloud service called Azure. **_BONUS - IF 25 or More People RSVP to this event, one participant will win a Azure Raspberry Pi 3 Kit courtesy of Hackster._**

- Microsoft Azure's features and offerings have expanded greatly over the past couple years from the initial three services - Windows Azure, SQL Azure and App Fabric. Sean will go over exactly what services and their costs and where to find the components in the Cloud.
- Bring your own Wi-Fi enabled laptop, and a credit card to establish a Microsoft Azure account if do not have one already.
- Sean is a programmer-analyst who was one of the first to use Microsoft's SQL Azure around 2010 to provide the database backend of a Adobe ColdFusion Web application delivering the business graph and partner sales connections to over 6,000 salespeople worldwide.
