Join us to learn more about Electric Vehicles designed for the Power Racing Series. League races take place across the USA at Maker Faires from Spring until Fall. [Presentation will be happening](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256584345) during CT Hackerspace Open Space on December 5th. https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256584345 Teams range from families to top universities and everyone has fun. Designing the vehicles is the real challenge and innovation because they are a smorgasbord of mechatronics, every design is amazingly unique! One manned and possibly one autonomous vehicle will be on display. Members from CT's oldest team, formed in 2014, are going to be there and can answer your questions. Team founder Mark McCrate has prepared a presentation. This is sure to spark your interest and germinate more league teams.
