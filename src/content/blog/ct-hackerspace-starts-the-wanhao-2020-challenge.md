The WanHao 20/20 Challenge

![WanHao](/uploads/2017/02/wanhao-logo.png)

We are looking for 20 people to commit $20 to purchase the machine for community use at the space. (People are free to donate more to reach our goal even faster!)  Once the monies have been pledged, CTH will purchase and install the equipment at the space. Let’s get Printing!

The Good news is that a few years ago we won a fantastic 3D Printer from Lulzbot in a Hackerspace Contest. The printer has been great, logging in over 1,000 prints since it has been available to our community.  One reason for its success is the fact that we have kept in place rules to keep the machine stock, non-modified, and ready to use like it came out of the box. This has lowered the barrier to entry to hundreds of users who have used it over the past several years.

The concern is that a growing number of members in our community are ready to use a community machine at an intermediate or advanced level. People looking to try different filament, nozzles, and other cool modifications. Being that we wish to keep the lulzbot at default options has shackled some members creations. There has always been options to use many of the hand built machines, but sometimes the cost of time isn’t worth the effort for the print.

We are looking to add a second 3D printer to fulfill the demand and we are hoping to crowdfund the effort. The machine targeted is the WanHao 3D printer. It is cost effective for our needs, has positive reviews, and furthermore, a resilient community helping other WanHao owners with troubleshooting and modifications. The $400 goal will cover the cost of the machine and some common mods and consumables to get us started.
