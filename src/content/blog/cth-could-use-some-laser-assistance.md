Help Needed!

The installation of our Jamieson Laser has stalled, and the local distributor in Torrington was not available to help. Our team is asking help from our community for help diagnosing if our machine failure is (1) power supply based or (2) tube based. Please contact CT Hackerspace if you can help.

Thanks!
