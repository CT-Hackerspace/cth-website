CTHackerspace will be hosting Retro Computing Day on Saturday, April 26, 2025, 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM 

Our Retro Computing meeting is for people to discuss old computers and related topics such as software, operating systems and experiences. We plan on also reconditioning old machines, build kits for modern usage, and car pool to related events. We welcome all of those who just love retro computers and computing. Anyone is welcome to join and have fun.
