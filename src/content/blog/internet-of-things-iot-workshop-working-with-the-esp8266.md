Interested in the Internet of Things ( IOT ) you have been hearing so much about? Want to publish values from a sensor to the Internet or your LAN? Interested in Low Cost Microcontrollers that have built in Networking? If you answered yes to any of these questions, this work shop is for you. This workshop will introduce you to the ESP8266 family of Wifi capable Microcontrollers that are more powerful than an Arduino yet can be purchased for less than $5. This 2+ hour workshop will introduce you to the basics of working the ESP8266 Wifi Microcontroller and the NodeMCU Firmware. You will learn how to “Flash” new Firmware to the controller as well as how to deploy Lua script to the microcontroller to run your own programs. At the end of this workshop you will bring home a working ESP8266 Microcontroller that you can customize to connect to your own network to send/receive commands/data over Wifi. You will need to bring your own laptop (with Administrator credentials so you can load the necessary software). You may want to bring your home Wifi credentials as well so that you can set your module up to connect at home as well.  All other materials will be provided. The cost is $45 per person including all provided materials. Advanced sign-up and payment is required. Please sign up through

Instructions for making payments will be sent via email. The class may be cancelled in advance of the date if too few people sign up for it so please feel free to bring a friend to ensure that this class is a success!
