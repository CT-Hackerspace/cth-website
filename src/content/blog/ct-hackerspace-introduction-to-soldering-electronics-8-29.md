## CTH Introduction to Soldering

RSVP by August 1st to allow ordering time for instructional kits

You’ll learn the basics of using molten metal to make electronics projects come to life. You’ll also learn some basic techniques for removing soldered components. This introductory class is to help those with low or no soldering experience. By the end of class, you will have gained practical knowledge of many electronic components, along with gaining a proficiency in soldering.

Each student will be given a variety of electronic parts and a printed circuit board. Over the period of the class, you will learn and identify basic electronic components and how to solder them into the provided kit. Each student will leave with a completed project, a European Siren with flashing lights. this kit can be used as an intruder alarm, bicycle siren, or just a plain attention getter.

This first class size is scheduled with a limit of six participants (due to stock of kits currently in stock) but will be re-hosted shortly if there is a high demand.

If you’ve always wanted to get into creating electronics, this is the class for you!

**Class will be $9 for non members, $4 members, plus $16 kit supplies. ($25 public, $20 members) Cash or Check to CT Hackerspace, or send Paypal to [CT Hackerspace Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/cthackerspace)**
