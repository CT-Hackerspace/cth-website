As additional cases are confirmed across the U.S., we want you to know that the CT Hackerspace team continues to monitor news and public information sources including Centers for Disease Control (CDC); World Health Organization; and state and local health departments for the communities that we are proud to be a part of.

As of now, nothing has changed with our meetings. If you feel uncomfortable, have traveled within the last month, or you are feeling under the weather, we suggest declining to visit the space at this time. We are also closely monitoring each day, and will notify you if this status changes.
