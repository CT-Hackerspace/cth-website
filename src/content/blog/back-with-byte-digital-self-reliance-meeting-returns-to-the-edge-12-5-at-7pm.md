**_Tuesday, December 5, 2017_** **_7:00 PM to 10:00 PM_**

Starting this month, let's embark on taking small steps to create and use digital communication methods that we own and control ourselves. Last time, during Digital Self Reliance's Meet & Greet, we discovered how centralized our communication is on the internet, and forged a solid understanding of how this has enabled powerful organizations to learn everything about us - far beyond what we would normally give out to anyone, especially not to ad-revenue-driven companies that are profiting from the information we trusted them with for the purposes of our business relationship with them. Starting this month, let's embark on taking small steps to create and use digital communication methods that we own and control ourselves.

1. Starting with our December meeting, we will disable the CT Hackerspace video camera during our meetups.
2. Setup an open-source online discussion forum (see [discourse.org](discourse.org)) so that we can communicate with each other "under the radar" - out of reach of those who would seek to data-mine our discussions.
3. All further meeting organization will be managed primarily from our online discussion - with only minimal information shared on the meetup.com website. Brief Presentation: Communicating on the Edge - I will give a very brief presentation on how we can communicate directly with each other - and stop passing messages through the Siren Servers.

## Agenda

- 7:00 - 7:15 - Casual Conversation, some pizza and beverages
- 7:15 - 7:30 - Presentation: Communicating on the Edge
- 7:30 - 8:30 - Start Working on setting up our online discussion software
- 8:30 - 10:00 - Informal Discussion, hacking, brainstorming, knowledge sharing, etc.

Looking forward to our next meeting and beginning to take concrete action toward DSR.
