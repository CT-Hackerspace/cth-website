# CT Hackerspace Class 11/17: Introduction to Web Publishing - 2: Beyond HTML

Take the leap from being a consumer of the World Wide Web to a Contributor! After the last workshop where we created a basic web page using basic HTML, we continue on how to create a web page to get you on your way. [![](/uploads/2018/09/html-word-cloud-300x300.jpg)](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/255088904/) Bring your PC / Laptop to class. The class will start with review our first workshop topics of using basic HTML, then Instructor Joshua Tenner will discuss the use of style sheets to the control look and feel of your pages as well as the power of JavaScript used in many everyday pages. (Future classes will cover these topics in greater detail.) Joshua Tenner is the Senior Web Developer of the Connecticut Dental Health Partnership - Husky Dental Program.
