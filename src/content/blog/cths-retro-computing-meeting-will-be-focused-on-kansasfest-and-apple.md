We will be tuning in live to Kansasfest during our retro Saturday!

## TOPIC: APPLE KANASASFEST LIVE!!

KansasFest (also known as KFest) is an annual event for Apple II computer enthusiasts. Held every July at Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri, KansasFest typically lasts five days and features presentations from Apple II experts and pioneers, as well as games, fun events, after-hours hallway chatter, late-night (or all-night) runs out to movies or restaurants, and more. A number of important new products have been released at KansasFest or developed through collaborations between individuals who likely would not have gotten together. Some of the most notable have been the introduction of the LANceGS Ethernet Card, and the Marinetti TCP/IP stack for the Apple IIGS.

Due to COVID-19, the 32nd annual KansasFest is virtual-only and will be held July 24â€“25, 2020. We will be tuning in live during our retro Saturday!

Our Retro Computing meeting is for people to discuss old computers and related topics such as software, operating systems and experiences. We plan on also reconditioning old machines, build kits for modern usage, and car pool to related events. We welcome all of those who just love retro computers and computing. Anyone is welcome to join and have fun.
