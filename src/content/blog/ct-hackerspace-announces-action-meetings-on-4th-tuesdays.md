# CT Hackerspace announces Action Meetings on 4th Tuesdays

Building on the great success of our first meeting, CT Hackerspace will start monthly Action Meetings to build on the initial success!

Ideas require actions for best results. Members of the CT Hackerspace's board invite any members of the community to join them in Action meeting night.

At CTH Action meetings, The board will discuss in more detail the plans for CTH and dive into the details and actions to move the space's improvements and growth forward.

If you are interested, and would like to be more involved in shaping the future and potential of CT Hackerspace, we invite you to attend to participate and take action!

Decisions are made by those who show up!

Items in our upcoming Action meeting include, but not limited to tasks committed to at previous action meetings, add any new pertinent items, and ANYTHING you want to improve our workshop.
