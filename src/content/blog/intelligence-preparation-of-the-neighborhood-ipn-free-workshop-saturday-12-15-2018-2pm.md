What don't you know? What do you need to know?

[Workshop Saturday, 12 / 15, 2018 2PM](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256791115)

IPN is a systematic, continuous process of analyzing the threat and environment in a specific area. It is designed to support estimates and decision making.

Applying the IPN process helps you selectively apply and maximize your capabilities at critical points in time and space. This _free course_ will provide an introduction to the IPN process, and how it applies to individuals and small groups or voluntary associations.
