In 2016, Hackster set on new mission: reach 50,000 makers and developers around the world through a physical network of Meetups and Workshops, focused on IoT education in the 21st century. Hackster - Watertown will have their initial meet and greet Wednesday night at CT Hackerspace 8/17/2016.

Hackster.io is an online community for hardware hackers. Are you an electronics newbie that wants to build the next awesome robot? Are you a seasoned pro that has more ideas than time? Are you somewhere in between? Hackster are looking for hackers and makers to share ideas, work on projects, and much more!

Led by a network of passionate ambassadors, they're giving communities and partners a voice in envisioning what's next in hardware, the cloud, and connectivity, and the magic that happens when they all come together. Hackster Ambassadors run live events that benefit their communities. Hackster supports them on the national level by providing access to hardware, software and learning materials through corporate partners. Hackster also provides training necessary to build a welcoming community and run stellar events.

Two local technology enthusiasts have teamed up and have been approved as Hackster Ambassadors. Bill Saturno and Louis DiCarro, both involved with cutting edge technologies and also key players in starting individual hackerspaces in Connecticut, are excited to start working with Hackster. They can't wait to empower local makers and developers on emerging technologies ...and they have figured what better place to host these events than CT Hackerspace. CT Hackerspace's facilities can handle groups of almost any size, and has resources in house needed from a hosting a small group lecture to a full fledged hackathon needing tons of tools and supplies within their 4,000 square foot facility.
