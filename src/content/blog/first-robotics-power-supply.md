I've had the honor of mentoring a local High School's [FIRST Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Inspiration_and_Recognition_of_Science_and_Technology) team. Their robot runs on a 12vdc battery. During most of the testing, the robot doesn't need to move too far, and watching the battery charge just seems like an unnecessary item to monitor. Â So, the alternative is to make a cheap, dedicated power supply. This thing started off as an old discarded laptop(or similar device) power supply. It had a plug on it, emphasis on 'had'. It got chopped in order to add a couple of binding posts. These bad boys will accept a bare wire or banana plug. I designed up a couple 'caps' and 3D printed them. They are pretty simple and made to fit a little snugly over the power supply. Eventually they will just be glued on to the power supply housing. In addition to the binding posts, there's an on/off switch and power indicator LED. Making these caps seemed like a great idea at the time but it was tight getting the components installed, wired and then crammed in there such a way that the cap would go on the power supply brick. I actually had to take it apart after gluing it because something was shorting inside (ground wire on the positive binding post stud). But the end result is a pretty slick looking dedicated power supply. Being non-adjustable is perfect for the Robotics Team as they can't turn it up too high!
