Have you been wondering about 3D printing? Are you thinking of buying or building your own 3D Printer? Do you have a printer but have questions? Has your 3D printer project stalled? Do you have one and want to learn more? Join us for a fun event centered around the 3D printing revolution and join in the fun.

Event starts Sunday, February 19, 2017 at  11:00 AM

If you are interested in this wonderful world of Fused Filament Fabrication, join us in a day long event. We have new members building thier first machines working side by side with CTH veteran who have been building machines at our space for over 7 years.  Learn about CAD and design options, share your experiences and lean some new ideas. Members and Non-Members are invited. There is no cost. If your printer project has stalled, bring it in and get it going again. We have all the tools you could need to continue your printer project! Several folks will be working on their printer projects. Come on down to help out, see the printers or just to check out our 'space! There will also be working printers on site in case you need a piece or two for your project. If you don't have a printer but feel like tinkering, we have 2 community printers that could use your help! UPDATE: We will be testing a brand new prototype for 3D print smoothing. Safer than acetone bath and supposedly works on a variety materials. The chemical is in for the testing. Bring your test parts to see how they finish! Show up any time, the 'space will be open for several hours. Past 3D Parties at CTH have had over a dozen machines and dozens of attendees and we are hoping this one is just as great!
