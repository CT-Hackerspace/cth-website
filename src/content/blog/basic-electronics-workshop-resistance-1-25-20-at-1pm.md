Conveniently scheduled prior to our Retro - Computing Meetup, Join us at CT Hackerspace for an hour of Electronics Fundamentals Review. Learn or refresh yourself on the basics to help you in everyday projects.

This month's class will cover Resistance and ohms law. If you have your own multimeter or ohmmeter, feel free to bring it along (although it is not required to attend, just as an extra help to learn on your own equipment) This is a One hour workshop
