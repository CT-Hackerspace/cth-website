Tonight's Workshop we will talk about Javascript. From the beginner who wants to understand the basics, to the more seasoned programmer that wants to discuss more in depth, we will explore the world of JavaScript which is so embedded in today's applications.

Come join us once a month to share and learn about the craft of software development, at the CT Hackerspace. We are a group of developers, programmers, hackers, creators and inventors committed to learning new coding skills, and furthering our software projects.

If you're totally new to programming, we can guide you through the basics and introduce you to a community of other people all working to improve their own skills in a supportive environment. And if you're an experienced developer already, think of this as your chance to get some cool work done, or a chance to pick up a new technical skill!
