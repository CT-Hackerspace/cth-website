Hello fellow Makers! *CTHackerspace* is once again hosting our Maker Day on March 29th, 2025 10AM-4PM! Come by to chat with fellow makers, learn how to use the equipment around our space, make progress on that cool crafting project you have been putting off, show off something you have been working on, and so on. This event is to help folks connect with others in our community who also love to make, build, and share their creativity.
