CT Hackerspace has an opportunity to purchase a newer Bridgeport head to replace our existing one.

This new head would help our machine to be fully operational with more turning speeds, and run on better bearings.

We also have the opportunity to $$ DOUBLE YOUR DONATION $$ right now with a _private 1 to 1 matching program_ to make your donation dollars work twice as hard. Help us hit this $500 Goal before we loose out on this opportunity!
