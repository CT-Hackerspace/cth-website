![Tabletop Games](/uploads/2017/01/tabletop-games-150x150.jpg)CT Hackerspace hosts Waterbury Area Gaming Society! The Waterbury Area Gaming Society is dedicated to the promotion and appreciation of gaming in all its forms. We look to provide a place for people to meet and have fun, and to share new games with each other. Gaming runs from 1:00 until everyone wants to leave! Anyone is free to come and play from any of the games we've brought, or bring your own to share with us. All ages are welcome - gamers under 18 please bring a parent.

Our first hosting will be on January 22nd at 1pm-10pm
