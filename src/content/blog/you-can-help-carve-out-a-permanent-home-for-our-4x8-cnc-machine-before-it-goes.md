# YOU can help carve out a permanent home for our 4'x8' CNC Machine before it goes!

Recent changes have put the future of our 4' x 8' CNC Machine on notice! The CNC, which was on long term loan from one of our older members, has been slated for removal. Your immediate action can change this outcome.

An agreement has been made that the hackerspace can buy the machine permanently for a very reasonable price of $1500. If our users and supporters feel strong enough to make this permanent purchase for the space, **now is the time**.Â 

Replacement machinery would go for at least twice as much as well as coordinating efforts to build a new one from scratch. Keeping it is a far more attractive option if the community acts now!
