CT Hackerspace will be providing those who attend free sensors to add their own projects as well as raffling off a new official Arduino UNO Super Starter Kit to one of the attendees - One of the most popular microcontrollers in use.

To help celebrate ten years at CT Hackerspace, we asked the community what were your favorite workshops over the last ten years, and we are celebrating them all in 2020. CTH's Arduino Workshops was one of them.

CTH member Louis, active maker/inventor and instructor who is involved in many of the hacker / makerspaces in Connecticut, will be joining us in this one day workshop to explore the power of the Arduino microcontroller.
