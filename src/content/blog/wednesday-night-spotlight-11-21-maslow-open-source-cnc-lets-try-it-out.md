The Maslow CNC is a unique “vertical” CNC router and is notable for its low cost. The unique vertical design mimics a hanging plotter allowing it to have a 4′ x 8′ cutting area with a footprint 10′ wide x 19″ deep.

Maslow CNC graciously provided CT Hackerspace the official kit to start the project. The CT Hackerspace community, active in hobbyiest CNC ventures, immediately took up a collection for additional materials needed to build out the machine. The community is excited to see the Maslow running in our workshop, side by side with 2 existing DIY CNC builds, along with the Stepcraft Multifunction CNC.
