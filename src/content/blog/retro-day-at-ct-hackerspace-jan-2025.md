- an Atari 7800 modded with composite video out,
- a Compaq Pentium 1 Laptop running MS-DOS, 
- a Pocket 386 'laptop' with a custom ISA16 breakout expansion board,
- an Arduino-based memory tester for 4164 RAM chips (which will be used for an upcoming Colecovision RAM upgrade)
- a PicoGUS, a modern replacement for the Gravis UltraSound soundcard based on the RaspPi Pico for vintage computers,

All this was in addition to our inhouse regularly available Atari 2600, CRT Game Station (Xbox, Wii, PS2, etc), and our retro computer collection that include an Apple IIgs and Commodore PET.
