Retro Gaming at CTH 4th Saturdays 3pm - 6pm

The perfect segue from CTH's Retro Computing Meetup is to roll into Retro Gaming Night. Retro gaming, also known as classic gaming and old school gaming, is the playing or collecting of older personal computer, console, and arcade video games in contemporary times. Usually retrogaming is based upon systems that are obsolete or discontinued. Join us as we discuss, repair, and PLAY games on classic consoles and emulators.
