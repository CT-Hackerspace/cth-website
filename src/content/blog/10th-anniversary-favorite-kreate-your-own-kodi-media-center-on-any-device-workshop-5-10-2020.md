After taking Mom out for breakfast, join us at CT Hackerspace as member Jason will take you through a thorough step by step process to add a Kodi Media Center on your own Hardware, regardless of what it is! What is Kodi? It is an entertainment hub that brings all your digital media together into a beautiful and user friendly package. It is 100% free and open source, very customisable and runs on a wide variety of devices. It is supported by a dedicated team of volunteers and a huge community. Many people get bogged down and discouraged to try to do the install themselves. Let your friends at CT Hackerspace help you along!

## What to bring

Bring your Firestick, Raspberry Pi, Android, Apple, Windows, or Linux machine and get ready to get up and running!

## Important to know

Make sure to also bring along along an appropriate usb stick / SD card / hard drive (if needed) to install your software on the device.

Class fee: $5 / CTH Members this is a FREE Class
