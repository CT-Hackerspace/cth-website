# SAVE THE DATE!

August 4th is Startup Day Across America. Startup Day Across America connects elected officials with the startups in the communities they represent so that they can learn about the challenges new companies face and meet the business leaders building the future. Congresswoman Esty is planning on a visit at 9:30 AM on August 4th, National Startup Day. We will also be discussing the positive impact local startup businesses  have on our on our economy and the benefits it has provided to the community, as well as the importance of startups to the growth of the American economy. Congresswoman Esty's visit coincides with Startup Day Across America, a nationwide effort to raise awareness of entrepreneurial activity and job creation and help generate support for startup communities across the country. Startup Day Across America also provides local entrepreneurs with an opportunity to educate their elected officials about the challenges they are facing and discuss how federal policy can support their efforts to test new ideas, create new products, and grow their businesses.

**We are looking to exhibit some of the innovative products that our community has created along with a round table with any Connecticut startups, innovation spaces, entrepreneurial financing establishments, and colleges/universities who wish to participate. So, please grab your creations and save the date of August 4th, Startup Day!**
