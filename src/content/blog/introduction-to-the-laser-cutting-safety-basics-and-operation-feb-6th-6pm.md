As we wait for the repairs on the CT Hackerspace Laser, member Joe P is offering time and instruction utilizing his laser that resides at the space. If you have a digital design and/or laser-able item, bring it to class.  
Members $35 / General Public $50 - Bring to Joe.

You will need to attend this class if you wish to use Joe's personal laser in the future.
