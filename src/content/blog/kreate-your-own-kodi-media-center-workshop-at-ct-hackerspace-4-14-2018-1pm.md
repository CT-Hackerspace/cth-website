Kreate your own Kodi Media Center on any device!

CT Hackerspace member Jason will take you through a thorough step by step process to add a Kodi Media Center on your own hardware, regardless of what it is! What is Kodi? It is an entertainment hub that brings all your digital media together into a beautiful and user friendly package. It is 100% free and open source, very customisable and runs on a wide variety of devices. It is supported by a dedicated team of volunteers and a huge community. Many people get bogged down and discouraged to try to do the install themselves. Let your friends at CT Hackerspace help you along! Bring your Firestick, Raspberry Pi, Android, Apple, Windows, or Linux machine and get ready to get up and running!Â Donation of $20 requested. ($15 for CTH members)
