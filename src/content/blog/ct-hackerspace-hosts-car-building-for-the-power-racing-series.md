## Every Second Thursday, 7PM

Help design and build a race car to compete in the national Power Racing Series! Power Racing series is a racing competition where teams build a $500 Power Wheel (Or any electric kidsâ€™ ride on vehicle.) and modify it to go as fast as it can. Host and CT Hackerspace member Mark McCrate rallys the team for a truly fun and memorable time.
