The team of CTVR, an enthusiast group leading the way with Virtual Reality in Connecticut, will be on site discussing and showing off the latest in VR technology. VR is great for gaming and entertainment but it can also be applied to education, business, medical and more. Stop by CT Hackerspace Tuesday, September 27 - We hope to see you (or your avatar) there! We welcome content creators, developers, investors or people who are simply curious about Virtual Reality. While our focus is on VR, we welcome those with experience in AR (Augmented Reality) as well. More details to follow soon. ..Please be advised that by attending any CTVR Group event and/or trying out any VR technology demo, you are indicating your agreement to the terms of the [CTVR Group Waiver and Release of Liability Form.](https://www.meetup.com/CTVR-Group/about/).
