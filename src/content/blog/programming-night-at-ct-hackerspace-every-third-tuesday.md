Come join us once a month (every third Tuesday) to share and learn about the craft of software development at CT Hackerspace. We are a group of developers, programmers, hackers, creators and inventors committed to learning new coding skills, and furthering our software projects.

If you're totally new to programming, we can guide you through the basics and introduce you to a community of other peopleÂ all working to improve their own skills in a supportive environment. And if you're an experienced developer already, think of this as your chance to get some cool work done, or a chance to pick up a new technical skill!

Your Topics also welcome - this night is for everyone to share.
