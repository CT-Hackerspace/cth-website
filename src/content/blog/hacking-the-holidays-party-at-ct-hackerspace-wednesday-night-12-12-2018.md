What to bring:

- **Potluck Item** (Optional) Anything from a simple munchie snack to a main course, desert or beverage. There is a full stove, microwave and refrigerator on premises for heating and cooling needs.
- **Grab Bag Item** (Optional) Preferably something that you already have but don’t use. Perhaps something that is made, hacked or otherwise modified. Or maybe a tool for something that you thought you were going to start doing but never did. Basically try not to go out buying stuff for the grab bag. Wrap it up, drop it in the bag and you will be able to pick from the selection of other items brought in for the grab bag.
- **Family & Friends** (Optional) Bring along family and friends that you have been unable to explain the hackerspace to. Show off some of the projects you have been working on etc.
- **Yourself** (Required) We hope to see you there!
