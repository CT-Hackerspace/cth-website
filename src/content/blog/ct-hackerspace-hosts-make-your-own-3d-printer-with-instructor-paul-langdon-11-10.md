They will also learn how to connect the printer to their computer, set it up and actually make things. There are no prerequisites for this class other than having a computer and being able to operate it.  Cost of this class is $200, and this INCLUDES the cost of the Prusa i3 3D printer kit. A registrant is welcome to bring a friend, team, or family to help participate. (A separate $5 per person cost will be taken day of class to get Pizza/Drinks for lunch break) Paul has created a reference page for all his resources at [the readme here.](https://github.com/plangdon/3D-Printer-2018/blob/master/README.md).
