[**_Scaling Up with CircuitPython Workshop Thursday, November 15, 2018_**](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256072526/)

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the hobbyist community. It is easy to learn and has strong community support. It is used for a variety of tasks from AI to server administration and now even to run microcontrollers. CircuitPython is becoming a great alternative to programming microcontrollers and is built specifically to do so. It simplifies the process of writing code for your board and gives quick results. We will be looking at programming the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express with CircuitPython. We will also take a look at what boards are available.
