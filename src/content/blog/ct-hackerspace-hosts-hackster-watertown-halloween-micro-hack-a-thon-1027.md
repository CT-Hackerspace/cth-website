Halloween is right around the corner and we all have to get our holiday related projects finished.

So what better way than to have a micro hack-a-thon to get that final push in?

[PLEASE REGISTER AT HACKSTER WATERTOWN MEETUP LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Hackster-it-Hardware-Meetup-Watertown/events/234916882/)

No matter what your project is - prop, costume, accessory, incantations to the spirit world - being it along! Stuck on a particular part of your costume and prop? Our community of hackers will help you get to the next step. Accidentally summon a restless spirit? Put them to work in the machine shop!

Don't have a project? No worries! We will also run a demo of build your own screaming pumpkin with an Arduino. You will need to bring your own Arduino (Uno would be best), laptop with the Arduino IDE installed, and a prop to put your creation in - we will provide the rest of the components.

All spirits mush pass machine shop training before starting any work. Poltergeists are limited to lathes and drill presses. See you all Thursday Night, october 27th.
