**Attention all makers! CT Hackerspace is proud to host a public talk and workshop by nationally renowned speaker Joel Leonard, the "Maker's Maker" on Sunday, March 8, 2020. Starts at 10 AM**

CT Hackerspace, a community workshop in Watertown, Connecticut, welcomes everyone interested to attend this special event. This is a free event, as CT Hackerspace continues it's 10 year anniversary celebration.

Joel's work in the maker movement has been recognized and awarded by the Nation of Makers for him being "The Biggest Maker Advocate." Between 2017-2019, he traveled through 35 states meeting with more than 80 makerspaces. During his Maker Happen Tours, Joel helped leaders build and tweak their organizations to better serve their communities. He participated in 16 makersfaires, events where people show what they have crafted at their local makerspaces, share ideas and network.  He met with economic development boards, explaining how makerspaces can supplement community college curriculum by teaching how to use machines used in manufacturing, thereby building a local workforce.

Joel will share his stories and maker insights with those in attendance as well as participate in maker discussions. Afterwards, Joel plans to hold his now famous  'Hold My Beer" planning sessions with the CT Hackerspace team, and energize and engage their member base with suggestions to map out community build projects for 2020 as CT Hackerspace's community continues to thrive and grow in more mature directions in the next decade.  
This event will be held at CT Hackerspace's Workshop, located on the third floor at 30 Echo Lake Road, Watertown, Connecticut. The exact start time on Sunday morning March 8th will be announced soon.
