I got a new 3d printer recently, and it's working very well! These are models that I extracted directly from a video game called Guild Wars II, and printed them using my printer. It's crazy that it's possible to bring something from a video game into real life, and I'm rather proud of it.

This all started because my wife sent me some tutorials how to take a model from a game and then 3D print it. This tutorial explained how to extract your character from the game itself, but I just wanted a dagger from the model.

When I took the screen capture from the tutorial, I was able to obtain half a dozen 3d models from the game itself including a Sword, Dagger, Environmental Creatures and a War Horn.

I wanted to paint them, so I also printed a vice to hold it while I apply the paint.
