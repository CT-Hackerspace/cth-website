Paul Langdon, active maker/inventor and instructor who is involved with MakeHartford as well as being a Hackster.IO ambassador, will be offering his class at CT Hackerspace. During this workshop, students will use a kit to assemble their own Prusa i3 style printer, which they will then get to keep and take home. They will also learn how to connect the printer to their computer, set it up and actually make things. There are no prerequisites for this class other than having a computer and being able to operate it.  Cost of this class is $200, and this INCLUDES the cost of the Prusa i3 3D printer kit. A registrant is welcome to bring a friend, team, or family to help participate. (A separate $5 per person cost will be taken day of class to get Pizza/Drinks for lunch break) Paul has created a reference page for all his resources at https\://github.com/plangdon/3D-Printer-2018/blob/master/README.md. This workshop is fully sold out and we will run a repeat class if enough interest is expressed.
