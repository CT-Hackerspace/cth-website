TODO:

- Add link to Google Calendar at the end of the list of events.
- Scale images to not be ludicrously huge.
- New events page
-- events.astro in the menu.
-- Placeholder content.
- Add an "icon" to the BlogSearchRecord object.
- Make the events (on the front page, at least) collapse the description, unless hovering (allow a tap on mobile).
