# Welcome to the CT Hackerspace Website!

CT Hackerspace is a DIY and Technology oriented group located in Watertown, Connecticut. We provide a community workshop and prototyping center to help make your ideas real.

We are the First and Oldest Makespace in Connecticut and we have lasted this long for a reason, and that reason is you! CT Hackerspace’s goal has always been to build a community of makers that collaborate and learn together no matter who they are, or where they come from.

We can’t wait to meet you, so come down and join our making family! We have a 4,000 sq ft space full of tools, materials and knowledgeable members, who are willing to help turn your idea into an achievable project.
