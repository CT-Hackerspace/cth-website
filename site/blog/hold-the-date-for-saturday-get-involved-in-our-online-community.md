# Hold the Date for Saturday - Get Involved in our Online Community.

![WebBuild image](/uploads/2015/07/WebBuild-image.png)

CT Hackerspace is changing our website from Drupal to WordPress. One reason for the change is to make it easier for members to create web content on the new cthackerspace.com website. This informal information session will walk though the steps on how to create a web content on our new site as well as explore the available post options. To get the most of out this meetup, please do the following:

1. email Rich (Event Host) through [MeetUp Link](http://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/) requesting a CTH WordPress account. Please also let himÂ know your preferred User Name and email address. (Prior registration saves time the day of event for all)
2. Prepare something to write about. You will be able to create your own content that will be posted that day. You can write about a project of yours, upload a photo gallery, talk about an interesting event or whatever.
3. Bring your computer and enthusiasm!
