The normally scheduled month Retro - Computing and Gaming Event will be bumped to next Saturday, May 29th

![Flyer](/uploads/2021/04/21-flyer-2-scaled-1.jpeg)

On a suggestion by Tom, let us take this opportunity to unload some stuff, grab new gear, and hang out while have a good fime together!

The plan will be to meet up at 7am at CT Hackerspace and caravan together. If it's easier, join the caravan in route.

We will decide on traveling communication protocols prior to event.

we can also use the opportunity to cover each others table prior to the event ðŸ˜€
