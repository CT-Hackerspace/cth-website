JOIN our Team for our latest group project: The Strandbeest ! A creative conversation between to members of the CT Hackerspace Community, Fred and Matthew, has now lead to a new Project at CTH: The Strandbeast Project.

Not only is this project highly educational and thought provoking excersize (with a high _coolness factor_), but is a real possibility thanks to two of our sponsors: [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) and [Stepcraft CNC.](https://www.stepcraft.us/)
