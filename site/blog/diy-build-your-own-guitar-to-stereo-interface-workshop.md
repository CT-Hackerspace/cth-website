This is an interface/filter to allow a guitar to be plugged directly into any receiver that accepts line level RCA style inputs . Practice your skills on the fly without having to lug around a big amp. We will make this an afternoon class in case you have a gig Saturday night.

Prepayment required to allow purchase of all materials needed to assemble. Price: $33.00 /per kit

(Key holding CT Hackerspace members get a $5 discount)

Basic soldering skills recommended but not necessary. We'll teach you.
