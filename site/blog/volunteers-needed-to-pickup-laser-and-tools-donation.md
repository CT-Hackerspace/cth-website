# VOLUNTEERS NEEDED to pickup LASER and tools Donation

![moving (B&W)](/uploads/2019/02/moving-black-white.jpg)

CT Hackerspace wishes the best of luck to our friend Jack G. as he is moving south. Jack wishes to GIVE back to our cause by donating some items, including a 60Watt Co2 Laser!!  
We are meeting at CT Hackerspace and carpooling to the Vernon area to pickup items, and then returning to unload at the hackerspace. We need volunteers to help. (A truck is already secured for the day)
