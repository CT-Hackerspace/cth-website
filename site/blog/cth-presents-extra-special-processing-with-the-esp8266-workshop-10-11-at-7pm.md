Want a cheap and easy way to get WiFi or Bluetooth into your project? Take a look at the ESP8266 and ESP32 modules. Both come on boards that are very inexpensive and can be programmed through the Arduino IDE. These modules can be found all over the internet in various form factors and it can be confusing which to use. ![](/uploads/2018/10/ESP8266-Capture.png)

## [Arduino Pi and Microcontrollers Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/255157913/)

## October 11, 2018 7PM

[Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/255157913/)

We will attempt to clear up some of the mystery of the module and dig into the capabilities of it. There will also be a review of different boards that the module is available on and look at the differences between them. Finally, we will run some demo projects to demonstrate the capabilities. You can find these boards on Adafruit, Sparkfun, Amazon, and eBay. So if you would like to play along during the presentation, order them from one of the links below and bring your computer with the Arduino IDE installed and we will walk through getting set up.
