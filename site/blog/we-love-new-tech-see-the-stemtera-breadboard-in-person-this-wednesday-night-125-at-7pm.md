# WE LOVE NEW TECHNOLOGY !!

[STEMTERA](/uploads/2017/01/STEMTERA_1024x1024-300x169.jpg)

Just arriving from a kickstarter backed campaign, this is the first run prototype boards of the STEMTera Breadboard - Arduino compatible built-in breadboard. It's the world's first Arduino compatible built-in breadboard with Arduino shields, LEGO® bricks and native USB support.

## SEE IT IN PERSON THIS WEDNESDAY NIGHT 1/25/2017

The STEMTera goals are to Improve Adaptability, Mountability and Protection. The STEMTera Breadboard has a LEGO® compatible bottom cover that enables LEGO® bricks to be connected directly into STEMTera Breadboard without using special mounting or adapters. It has USB Enhancement Without Extra Components. With ATmega32U2 exposed, users can now develop native USB projects with an extra 21 IO pins. These extra IO pins can work directly with the LUFA framework without having a middleman to translate messages like the original Arduino UNO. Reduce Messy WiresSTEMTera Breadboard eliminates messy wires by having two microcontrollers built inside the breadboard, thus providing direct access to ATmega328P and ATmega16U2’s IO pins. FEATURES Dual Microcontroller With a total of 41 IO pins of which 9 provide PWM. Pin-to-pin compatible with Arduino UNO R3 shield . LEGO® compatible bottom cover The bottom cover of STEMTera Breadboard will fit into a 10x14 LEGO® base plate. USB native development Exposed ATmega32U2 allows native USB development. LED embedded 4 LEDs beautifully mounted flush with the breadboard. Multiple IDE support Atmel® Studio, Arduino IDE, AVR-GCC, AVR-GCC with LUFA, Scratch, etc. Strong enclosure Built with strong ABS plastic.
