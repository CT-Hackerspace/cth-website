# ArduinoPi at CT Hackerspace Presents Workshop: Sending Data to the Cloud

[![Arduino Communications](/uploads/2018/04/arduino-communications-300x169.png)](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/249832730/)

<hr />

There was so much information in the first session that we had to split into two! In the first session, we learned about shields for the Arduino, using a temperature sensor with the Arduino, and using libraries for both. We also had an overview of the Internet of Things, the Cloud, and dashboards on IoT services such as Adafruit IO. On May 10th, we are going to bring it all together where we will set up a dashboard on Adafruit IO, read the temperature sensor, and push the data to the dashboard for our viewing pleasure! We will need the Ethernet shield, temperature sensor breakout board, and our Arduino. If you don't already have an account on adafruit.com, create one before the class. If you have already bought something on adafruit.com or created and an account, it should transfer over to Adafruit IO. Test it out at io.adafruit.com. Bring your Arduino, Laptop with Arduino IDE working, USB cable.
