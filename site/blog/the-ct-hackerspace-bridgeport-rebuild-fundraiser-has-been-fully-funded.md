We are proud to announce CT Hackerspace has reached their goal of $500 to purchase a newer Bridgeport head to replace our existing one.Â  This new head would help our machine to be fully operational with more turning speeds, and run on better bearings.

Helped by "Team Wade and Matt", who sponsored the _1 to 1 matching program_ to make donation dollars work twice as hard.
