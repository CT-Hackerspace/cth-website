Our new secretary, Reed Hansen, wants to start a committee of motivated people to investigate the possibility to get status as a proper 501 (c)(3) organization. Although CT Hackerspace is currently all volunteer club, we are looking for a team of people to discuss taking the organization to the next level. Due to the summer heat, the meeting will take place across the street at Gayle's Depot Square Farm Shoppe.
