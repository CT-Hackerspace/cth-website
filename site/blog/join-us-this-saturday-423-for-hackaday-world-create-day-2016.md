## The Goal

Form a team (or work on your own) and submit a project to the Hackaday Prize design challenge. See challenge details [here](https://hackaday.io/prize/details#one).

Need some inspiration for your project?

Here are some ideas:

- Citizen Science - Build a graphene supercapacitor, study the effects of a behavior, build an open source instrumentation device.
- Automation - Build a device that makes breakfast or buys laundry detergent when youâ€™re running low. Automatically track stuff, automate any process, build a Me-robot to do your every whim
- Assistive technologies - Build a project that helps others move better, see better, or live better. Whether that means exoskeletons, a better wheelchair, a braille display, or educational software, we want to see it.
- Or any other idea you have to hack for social change! Leverage your talent and find solutions to address technology issues facing humanity today.
