# When your Hackerspace combines Work, Home and Fun!

<hr />

Joe Stanzo joined CT Hackerspace this year, and has become an active member in our community.

Joe is seen here utilizing the hackerspace for building his other community pursuits as well.

Besides showing up at regular Open House Wednesdays, Joe also sponsors meetings of the Waterbury Gaming Society in house as well as attending other workshops of interest. Joe works at Barnum Financial Group in Shelton since October 2014 and is active in his company's events as well.

At a recent job related event, Joe wanted to create a social media prop of a Polaroid Frame which could be used by himself and his colleagues.

Joe probably could have made room at home, bought all the supplies, and made a mess that required getting paint and sawdust out of his carpet. He also would have awkwardly found room to work on such a large project. Instead, he decided on utilizing the hackerspace to complete this project for work. The project build was more fun, received help from fellow CTH members ...and no scrubbing the paint and sawdust out of the carpet!
