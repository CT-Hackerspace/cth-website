Many members in our community recognize the full value in what open source can mean with a direct correlation to innovation. We are very excited to see that [Lulzbot](https://www.lulzbot.com/content/fourth-annual-lulzbot-hackerspace-giveaway) recognizes our commitment to open source by choosing CT Hackerspace as a winner to their 3D printer giveaway contest.

We look forward to working with a community with innovation at the core of their “open” philosophy. The [Lulzbot Mini 3D printer](https://www.lulzbot.com/products/lulzbot-mini-3d-printer) will be a great tool to have in pursuing future inventions and creations by both our members and our surrounding community. UPDATE: Our printer worked right out of the box. The heated build platform and automatic bed probing works excellent. This printer is a real workhorse. Check out our dedicated Lulzbot work station, it's always ready to rock and roll:
