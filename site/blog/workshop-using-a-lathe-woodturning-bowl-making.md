In this full day workshop, you will learn basic bowl making on the lathe, going from a rough cut piece of wood to creating a finished bowl.

The class will cover the woodturning basics including Introduction, demonstration, and then the remainder of the day will include hands-on guided time. Topics will cover initial mounting, roughing to round and hogging off, techniques for re-mounting the bowl, shaping the exterior, and hollowing and creating the interior finish. In addition, the class will cover sanding; reversing the bowl blank; and turning the foot and bottom. There will also be discussion on green turning vs. dry turning techniques. The student should bring their own wood stock they are looking to turn.

Recommended woods include fine grain species such as maple, pear, and poplar. Students are welcome to reach out to the instructor prior to class day for wood stock consultation.

**Class size is limited. Reserve your space as soon as possible.**

Class $45,Â CTH Members $25
