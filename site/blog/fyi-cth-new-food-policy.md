# FYI - CTH New food policy

As you know, we try to keep rules to a minimum as we all respect the hackerspace and community. Due to a recent ongoing problems over the last few months of pests finding discarded food remnants in trash containers, the board has requested that **all your food related trash, recyclables, and empty containers be taken with you out of the space at the end of your visit **- This includes cans and bottles purchased from the refrigerator.

Also, do not throw away trash in other trash receptacles on site at Echo Lake (including dumpsters in the parking lot) To keep costs down, the hackerspace does not pay for trash service, and all trash generated from the space has always been removed / recycled by volunteers and good samaritans.Thanks for your help in keeping our space great.
