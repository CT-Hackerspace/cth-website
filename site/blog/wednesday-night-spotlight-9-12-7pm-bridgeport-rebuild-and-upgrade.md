On the heels of our fundraising event, we have new parts and a refurbished Bridgeport head to install to upgrade our current metal shop machinery. We invite all those interested in learning more about the Bridgeport intimately to be involved in seeing and participating in the rebuild. Event happens During CTH Open Space Night 9/12, beginning around 7pm.
