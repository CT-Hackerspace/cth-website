Bill Saturno, co-founder and president of CT Hackerspace, along with colleagues of some neighboring Connecticut makerspaces, were among those invited to discuss these emerging centers of innovation. The Hackerspace / Makerspace concept has gained support from numerous government agencies for its connection to workforce development, innovation, manufacturing, and contributions to tomorrowâ€™s game changers and the next disruptive technology.
