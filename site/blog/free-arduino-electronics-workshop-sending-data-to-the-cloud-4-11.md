Let's do something interesting with our Arduinos! We have learned about inputs and outputs for the Arduino and also how to use sensors. So now let's put all of these together and make a project that will collect and save this data. In this session, we will use a shield and a library to get our Arduinos to connect to the Internet, attach and program sensors to collect data, then send this data to the cloud! We will use a data collection service to help build a dashboard to display our findings.

An Arduino shield will be provided.
