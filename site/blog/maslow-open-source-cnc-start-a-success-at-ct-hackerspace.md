CT Hackerspace held an official unboxing night October 3rd for the Open Source Maslow CNC System.Â Maslow CNC is a unique "vertical" CNC router and is notable for its low cost. The unique vertical design mimics a hanging plotter allowing it to have a 4' x 8' cutting area with a footprint 10' wide x 19" deep.

Maslow CNC graciously provided CT Hackerspace the official kit to start the project. The CT Hackerspace community, active in hobbyiest CNC ventures, immediately took up a collection for additional materials needed to build out the machine. The community is excited to see the Maslow running in our workshop, side by side with 2 existing DIY CNC builds, along with the Stepcraft Multifunction CNC. The CT Hackerspace Team will continue working on building the Maslow CNC in future Wednesday Nights as well as scheduling some longer workshops in the upcoming future weekends. If you are interested in learning more, stop by CT Hackerspace during or public Open Space Wednesdays.
