Our new Microcontroller Meetings are now controlled by CT Hackerspace members, and have been a big success with a large, continued following. Dozens of attendees have started coming on a regular basis. This is a great time to be part of this re-launch!

[Our next Arduino Pi and Microcontrollers will be a Hardware Talk on Thursday, November 9, 2017.](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/244343952/)

With topics and direction now controlled by CT Hackerspace members, we are 100% on track with members' interests and the results are astonishing. Our RE-BOOT MEETING discussed the new strategy moving forward. Also as a thank you everyone who has stayed involved, as well as to welcome new members, all attendees who RSVPd recieved CTH Micro controller Inventor’s Kit filled with extras. [Our next Arduino Pi and Microcontrollers will be a Hardware Talk on Thursday, November 9, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/244343952/). CTH member and engineer Ed Kalin will give a talk covering basic electronics and principles related to micro controller builds. Since this is going to be a hands - on workshop, we are looking for the following supplies to share for the night within everyone in the group. Please bring extra Low voltage light bulbs, wire, alligator clips, masking tape, and multi-meters. In case you missed Ed's "Sneak Preview" , he is looking to cover the following in his hands on talk / workshop: Voltage / Current Conductor / Insulator Circuit / Short Circuit Resistance Electrical Units of measurement Grounds Pull up / Pull down resistors Voltage Dividers Potentiometers Current Source Current Sinking Digital Vs. Analog Inputs Vs. Outputs Switches : Definitions & Types Relays Digital to Analog Conversion Analog to Digital Conversion Series & Parallel Diodes / LEDS Wire Gauges Schematics We will NOT be covering : ICs, transistors, capacitors, inductors, AC voltage, RF related [Make Plans to attend today!](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/244343952/)
