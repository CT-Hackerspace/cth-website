Join CT Hackerspace as we take our car off pavement and participate in our first official race of the Power Racing Series at Ideal Farm & Garden in Lafayette, NJ. Cheer on our team (and even help out!) as we take months of work to the racetrack. This is surely going to be a fun weekend for everybody. During the month of October and at the Grand Re-Opening of the Ideal Farm Makers Fest will be busy with over 1,000 families visiting. See a race team member for more details and possible car pooling. This is sure to be a fun and invigorating experience!
