To help celebrate ten years at CT Hackerspace, we asked the community what were your favorite workshops over the last ten years, and we are celebrating them all in 2020. The MAKE YOUR OWN 3D Printer Workshop was one of them.

Paul Langdon, active maker/inventor and instructor who is involved with MakeHartford as well as being a Hackster.IO ambassador, will be offering his class at CT Hackerspace. During this workshop, students will use a kit to assemble their own Prusa i3 style printer, which you will then get to keep and take home. You will also learn how to connect the printer to a computer, set it up and actually make things. There are no prerequisites for this class other than having a computer and being able to operate it.

Cost of this class is $225, and this INCLUDES the cost of the Prusa i3 3D printer kit. A registrant can be individual, team build, or family.
