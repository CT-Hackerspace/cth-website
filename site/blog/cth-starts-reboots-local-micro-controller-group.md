![microcontrollers-1-150x150.jpg](/uploads/2017/10/microcontrollers-1-150x150.jpg)

Announcing ARDUINO / PI!

WE HAVE HEARD YOUR CONCERNS!

WE ARE RE-LAUNCHING OUR MICRO CONTROLLER GROUP LOCALLY,

With topics and direction now controlled by CT Hackerspace members.

Please Attend our RE-BOOT MEETING OCTOBER 12th where we will discuss the new strategy moving forward. To thank everyone who has stayed involved, as well as to welcome new members, all attendees who RSVP and show up will receive a CTH Micro controller Inventor’s Kit filled with extras to assist in your next Arduino / Raspberry Pi / ESP Project. Though it is past most regular business hours, please be respectful not block loading bays or active businesses. Entrance is the rear main door on second level, follow the signs and take one flight up. The Rear Entrance is located up at the top of the ramp.
