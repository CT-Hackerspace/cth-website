## UPDATE:

The current 3D Printing fundraiser to CT Hackerspace has been met with lackluster response. It is being revamped to now do a **revenue sharing** to attract more interest, as well as an opportunity for your OWN printer to become a revenue source. This will be less money that CT hackerspace will be able to make, but it will hopefully expedite the project ahead forward. See Bill or Dimitri for details.
