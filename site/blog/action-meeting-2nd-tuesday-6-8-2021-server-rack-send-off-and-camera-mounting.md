# Action Meeting 2nd Tuesday (6-8-2021): Server Rack Send-off and Camera Mounting

Ideas require actions for the best results. The CT Hackerspace invites any members of the community to join them on Action Meeting night.

If you are interested and would like to be more involved in shaping the future and potential of CT Hackerspace, we invite you to attend to participate and take action!

This week's focus will be getting our old server rack ready to send off to a new home and mounting our newly donated wireless security cameras so that we can make our space a more secure place.

Decisions are made by those who show up!
