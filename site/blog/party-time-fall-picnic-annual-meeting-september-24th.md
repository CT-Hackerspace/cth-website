Previously known as "State of the Space",

this is our annual get together to celebrate the CT Hackerspace community.

Enjoy the day, bring some food / drink to share.

We will get all of you up to date on the health and status of CTH, as well as some proposed changes moving forward. We also look forward to an open discussion on ideas that you want to tell everyone while together. Get involved and have fun.
