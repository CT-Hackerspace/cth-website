# You asked for it! CT Hackerspace are planning forums and updated chat

![you asked for it](/uploads/2021/01/you-asked-for-it.png)

By Request..

Since the outbreak of COVID-19 the in person social aspects of our community have definitely suffered. Since the popularity of our IRC chat has widely diminished over the last decade, our audience has requested newer services.

CT Hackerspace have volunteers to roll out both forums and a Discord channel. Stay tuned for updates. If this sounds interesting, and you would like to help build and assist, reach out to [Contact.CTHackerspace@gmail.com](mailto:Contact.CTHackerspace@gmail.com).
