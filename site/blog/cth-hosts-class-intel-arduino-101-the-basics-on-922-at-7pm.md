Learn how to program and use the Arduino. Discover the world of electronics prototyping!

[RSVP HERE](https://www.meetup.com/Hackster-it-Hardware-Meetup-Watertown/events/234176630/)

We will be doing a full on demo of the Intel Arduino 101 on September 28th and wanted to get people set up and learn the basics of the Arduino before then. In this class, we will get you familiar with the board itself, run through the Arduino IDE, and teach the basics of the programming language. Please bring a laptop with the Arduino IDE and drivers installed, an Arduino, and a compatible USB cable. We will have some equipment available but it will be limited. Â Let us know ahead of time if you will need equipment or if you are having trouble installing the IDE. [RSVP HERE](https://www.meetup.com/Hackster-it-Hardware-Meetup-Watertown/events/234176630/)
