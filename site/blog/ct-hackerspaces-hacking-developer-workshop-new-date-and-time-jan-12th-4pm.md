CT Hackerspace's Hacking & Developer Workshop will now be at an [updated new time and date](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/257069413) in our soon to be ready PC lab. _The Bad News:_ After Years of Hosting Tuesday Hacking and Programming Night, Andrew will be stepping down to take a new job position. CTH thanks him for years of unwavering commitment to our group and for hosting this monthly workshop. _The Great News_: We are amidst building a new CTH Computer Lab for our community, and Joshua Tenner has volunteered to pick up running this workshop and continue to move it ahead! Joshua is the Senior Web Developer of the Connecticut Dental Health Partnership - Husky Dental Program. Come join us once a month at [NOW ON THE SECOND SATURDAYS AT 4PM](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/257069413) - A more convenient time per member's request!

This is a general class for learning all aspects of how to do web publishing for all skill levels. If you're totally new to programming, we can guide you through the basics and introduce you to a community of other people all working to improve their own skills in a supportive environment. And if you're an experienced developer already, think of this as your chance to get some cool work done, or a chance to pick up a new technical skill! Joshua is excited to talk to everyone on what new directions this workshop can journey and hopes for all your input. For more information, please feel free to contact Joshua's email: [**tenner.joshua@gmail.com**](mailto:tenner.joshua@gmail.com).

The class will be run at CT Hackerspace's new (under construction) computer Lab. [Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/257069413)
