Many DIY projects require welding.  This can be a show stopper for many hobbyists.  Do you dream of building a roll cage, bicycle, tools or furniture?

In this two day introductory workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of welding.

Taught by Wade Barocsi an automotive welding and metallurgy instructor at NVCC.

Tuesday June 21st at 6-8:30pm and Saturday June 25th 1-3:30pm.

[You must RSVP on our Meetup Page to assure a spot in class!](http://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/231757791/?rv=ea1)

We will start with a bit of basic theory and safety.  It can be intimidating to get started welding because of the potential dangers involved and the complexity of the equipment. Starting with torch welding has a lot of advantages, what you learn by torch welding is applicable to all other forms of welding. We will also talk about welding on a budget, and what types of welding are best for you. This two day class will cover:

- Safety
- Oxyfuel welding
- Oxyfuel cutting
- Brazing Additional classes will build upon what you have learned and will include;
- MIG welding (GMAW)
- TIG welding (GTAW)
- Plasma Cutting

This introductory workshop will be required for future workshops, as the information builds upon past classes.
