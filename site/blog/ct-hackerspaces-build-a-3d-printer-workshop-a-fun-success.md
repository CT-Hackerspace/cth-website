Paul Langdon, active maker/inventor and instructor who is involved with MakeHartford as well as being a Hackster.IO ambassador, offered a full day workshop at CT Hackerspace. All participants assembled and took home their own Prusa i3 style printer! In addition Paul covered information on how to connect the printer to their computer, set it up and actually make things. Paul has created a reference page for all his resources at https\://github.com/plangdon/3D-Printer-2018/blob/master/README.md. More Photos of the event below:
