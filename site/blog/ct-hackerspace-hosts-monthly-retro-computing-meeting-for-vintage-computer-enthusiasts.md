First meeting scheduled for Saturday, March 23, 2019 , 2PM. Monthly Meetings to follow on 4th Saturdays of the month.

[Our Retro Computing meeting](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/259453906/) is for people to discuss old computers and related topics such as software, operating systems and experiences. We plan on also reconditioning old machines, build kits for modern usage, and car pool to related events. We welcome all of those who just love retro computers and computing. Anyone is welcome to join and have fun.
