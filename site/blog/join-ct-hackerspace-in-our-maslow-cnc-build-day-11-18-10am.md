After an official unboxing night and a series of built nights during Wednesday Night Open House, we're ready to get into our [1st weekend Build Day!](https://www.meetup.com/CT-Hackerspace/events/256132695/)

Join in the the CT Hackerspace community to continue out exciting build of our community Maslow CNC on Sunday November 18th.

The Maslow CNC is a unique "vertical" CNC router and is notable for its low cost. The unique vertical design mimics a hanging plotter allowing it to have a 4' x 8' cutting area with a footprint 10' wide x 19" deep.

Maslow CNC graciously provided CT Hackerspace the official kit to start the project. The CT Hackerspace community, active in hobbyiest CNC ventures, immediately took up a collection for additional materials needed to build out the machine. The community is excited to see the Maslow running in our workshop, side by side with 2 existing DIY CNC builds, along with the Stepcraft Multifunction CNC.
